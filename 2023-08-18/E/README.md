This problem requires us to answer the following: given a graph $G$, a source vertex $s$ and an integer $t>0$,
how many paths of length $t$ with source $s$ exist in $G$?

Solution:
* Let $A$ be the adjacency matrix of $G$;
* Then for each nonnegative integer $i$, and each pair of vertices $x, y$, $A^i_{x,y}$ counts the $x,y$-paths
of length $i$;
* Therefore, the answer to the problem is $\sum_{u} A^t_{s,u}$, i.e., we compute $A^t$ and sum the contents
of line $s$.

Ideally, one should use fast exponentiation for the third step, but it is not actually required by the
online judge, at least in C/C++.
