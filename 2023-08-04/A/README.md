# [YES or YES?](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1703/A)

The solution of this problem is as simple as checking each character of the input:

1. check if the first character is either `Y` or `y`;
2. check if the second character is either `E` or `e`;
3. check if the third character is either `S` or `s`;
4. if all of the above are true, then print `YES`, otherwise print `NO`;
