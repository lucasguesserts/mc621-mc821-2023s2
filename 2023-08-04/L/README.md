# [Game with Telephone Numbers](https://codeforces.com/contest/1155/problem/B)

The player who plays first wants to end the game having the sequence start with an 8.
The player who plays second wants anything but an 8 to start the sequence.

As such, they will take turns removing non-8s and 8s from the start of the sequence, respectively.
It remains to represent this removal efficiently and then checking whether the resulting sequence starts with 8.
