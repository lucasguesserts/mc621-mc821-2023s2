// ==================== Solution Description ====================

/*
# [Avion](https://open.kattis.com/problems/avion)

For each of the 5 lines of input we just need to check if it contains `"FBI"` as
a substring. This can be done in a number of ways:

* In Python, a native `'FBI' in input()` would suffice;
* In languages with Regular Expression libraries, use regex with pattern `"FBI"`;
* KMP algorithm: initialize the fallback table with pattern `"FBI"` and perform
a boolean search (stops at first match, returning `true`);
* Maybe even na√Øve search is fine, but I haven't tested.*/

// ==================== Code ====================

#include <iostream>
#include <regex>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    bool escaped = true;
    regex pattern("FBI");
    for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
        string s;
        cin >> s;
        if (regex_search(s, pattern)) {
            cout << i << " ";
            escaped = false;
        }
    }
    if (escaped)
        cout << "HE GOT AWAY!";
    cout << endl;
    return 0;
}
